  <p datetime="2025-02-25">Effective February 25, 2025</p>
  <p>Firefox is free and open source web browser software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world.</p>
  <p>Please read these Terms of Use (“Terms”) carefully because they explain important information about using your copy of the Firefox software. These Terms are a binding agreement between Mozilla Corporation (“Mozilla”) and You. For details about Firefox privacy practices, please read the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/">Firefox Privacy Notice</a>.</p>

  <p>Mozilla grants you a personal, non-exclusive license to install and use the “Executable Code" version of the Firefox web browser, which is the ready-to-run version of Firefox from an authorized source that you can open and use right away.</p>
  <section class="section3"><h3 id="firefox-is-open-source-software">Firefox is Open Source Software</h3>
  <p>We make the source code for Firefox available to you under the terms of various open source licenses, including the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">Mozilla Public License</a>. This means you may use, copy, modify, and distribute Firefox to others, as long as you follow the open source licenses and the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy/">Mozilla Trademark Guidelines</a>. These Terms only apply to the Executable Code version of Firefox, not the Firefox source code.</p>
  <p>In order to play certain types of video, Firefox may download content decryption modules from third parties which may not be open source.</p>
